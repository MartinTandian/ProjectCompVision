Computer Vision Attendance Recorder

This project aims to develop a system for recording student attendance using computer vision technology. Students will be required to direct their faces towards a camera for attendance recording. The system will then detect the student's identity by matching their face with a database containing their facial images. Once the student is recognized, their attendance will be logged along with the timestamp of their arrival.
